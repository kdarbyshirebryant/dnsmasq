Hi.

To translate my routers netstat-nat output into names that actually talk
to me I have started writing to simple shell scripts. They require 

log-queries
log-facility=/var/log/dnsmasq.log

to be set. With

netstat-nat -n -4 | reverse_replace.sh 

I get retranslated output.

Sincerely,
Joachim
